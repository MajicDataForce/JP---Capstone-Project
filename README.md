Power BI Capstone Project: Sales Performance Analysis

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Power BI Capstone Project! This project demonstrates my ability to create insightful data visualizations and actionable reports using Power BI, focusing on sales performance analysis for a hypothetical retail business.

Project Overview
The goal of this capstone project is to analyze sales data from a retail business to uncover trends, optimize inventory management, and improve customer insights. Through this analysis, I aim to demonstrate effective data preparation, visualization, and storytelling techniques using Power BI.

Features

Data Sources: Utilizes private source dataset, which includes transaction-level data on sales, profit, customer demographics, and regional performance.
Key Visualizations: This project includes several interactive dashboards to provide insights on:
    Sales Trends: Monthly and quarterly sales growth trends across product categories.
    Customer Segmentation: Insights into customer demographics, identifying high-value customer segments.
    Regional Performance: Regional comparison of sales and profitability.
    Product Profitability: Analysis of top-performing and low-performing products by profit margin.
Data Analysis: Features DAX-based calculations to perform:
    Year-over-Year Growth Analysis: Evaluating growth metrics over time.
    Profitability Calculations: Using custom DAX measures to calculate profit margins.
    Top N Analysis: Identifying top-performing products and regions.

Project Structure

Data Preparation: Cleaned and transformed raw data using Power Query to address missing values, remove duplicates, and create calculated columns.
Reports & Dashboards: Created Power BI dashboards with bookmarks and tooltips for easy navigation, providing a user-friendly experience for end-users.
Insights and Findings: The analysis reveals key insights, such as:
    Seasonal Sales Peaks: Higher sales volumes in Q2, 2015.
    Product Profit Discrepancies: Certain product categories are high in sales volume but low in profitability, indicating potential areas for margin improvement.


Getting Started

Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI: For data visualization, report creation, and interactive dashboard design.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating calculated measures and columns, such as Year-over-Year sales growth and profit margin analysis.
Power Query: Used for data cleaning, transformations, and data modeling to optimize dataset structure.
Key Learnings
This project enhanced my skills in:

Data Cleaning and Transformation: Using Power Query to prepare and transform data efficiently.
DAX Calculations: Leveraging DAX to create custom calculations for in-depth analysis.
Building Interactive Dashboards: Designing user-centric dashboards with an intuitive interface.
Storytelling with Data: Translating complex data findings into actionable insights for business users.
Future Improvements
In the future, I plan to:

Add more advanced visualizations like forecast projections for sales and profitability.
Integrate additional data sources, such as customer feedback, to enhance customer segmentation analysis.
Apply machine learning techniques for predictive analytics, such as predicting top-performing product categories.
